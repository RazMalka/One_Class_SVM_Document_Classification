The dissecting room was high-walled, white, full of strange apparatus
that only vaguely resembled similar machines of Earth. There was
the Martian fluoroscope with which Storm and Hammond were minutely
examined, and notes taken on a Martian "talkie"--evidently a highly
advanced type camera with sound track arrangement which recorded that
revealed by the fluoroscope and the comments of the observer.

The fluoroscope was a vast improvement over the earth type. Hammond,
watching Storm being examined with it, saw that any part of his
companion's internal anatomy could be brought into sharp focus on the
screen. Heart, lungs, bone structure, arteries. Each was minutely
examined, probed into--the while the Martian "talkie" hummed softly.

A number of strange drugs were needled into them as they stood behind
the fluoroscope. Drugs that burned like fire, contorting their bodies
with convulsions, and which were immediately eased by the introduction
of a neutralizing drug. Others that paralyzed motor nerves, and
that deadened the sensory cells. All was recorded by the laboratory
scientists.

Finally, Hammond and Storm were strapped on the dissecting tables. A
blinding, white light beat down on their almost naked bodies.

Zuggoth came into the laboratory then. For a few moments he and the
laboratory scientists held a consultation. Hammond, craning his neck,
could see the Sediphron king's crablike mouth work, see the ball-like
eyes wave on the end of their stalks.

The Martian "talkie" was run for him, the picture sequences thrown
against a special screen that held the scenes clear without the dimming
of the bright laboratory lights. Zuggoth watched attentively, only his
revolting eyes swaying.

Then he waved his huge claw. The "talkie" was shut off. Huge, hideous,
he walked to the dissecting tables. A smaller table, holding a gleaming
array of scalpels and cutting instruments of all types was wheeled to
his side.

[Illustration: _Zuggoth turned to Hammond. His dwarfed right hand,
humanlike, with tiny fingers, picked up a glittering knife._]

He turned to Hammond. His dwarfed right hand, humanlike, with tiny
fingers, picked up a knife.

       *       *       *       *       *

At that moment a hidden bell began to clang incessantly. Zuggoth
paused, half turned. The laboratory assistants fidgeted. One of them
said: "It is the alarm signal, First One. Something has happened in the
ship!"

Zuggoth hesitated. Then he flung the knife down on the small table.
"Keep guard over the Earthians, Cuzzvi," he snapped to the head
scientist. "I will see what's causing the trouble!"

Hammond's tightened muscles relaxed: the sweat on his forehead felt
cool. Unexpectedly, he had been given a breathing spell. But for how
long?

Instinctively he tested the flexible, silken straps that held him to
the table. They did not give, though his muscles bunched and strained.
There was a silken thong about his neck, holding his head down. He
turned his head, slowly, till he faced Storm.

"Looks like our friend Zuggoth never heard of an anesthetic," he
muttered, with an attempt at casualness he did not feel. "Funny thing,
Pete, it still doesn't seem real. All this, I mean. Just a few hours
ago we were in a skiff, fishing for blues. Now--"

Pete managed a grin. "Now we're still in the boat. Only it isn't--"

Looking toward Hammond, he was facing the laboratory door, and he saw
them first. Hybrids, armed with shield and electronic rifles. Two of
them. One of them carried red and green insignia on its dwarfed right
arm.

Hammond turned his head, warned by the look on Storm's face. The
laboratory head, Cuzzvi, saw the intruders a moment later. He drew up
stiffly, evidently noting the rank of the foremost hybrid. Then, all at
once, he whirled, gave a short cry of warning to his assistants, and
reached for an electronic rifle in a wall rack.

The rifles in the hands of the strange hybrids lanced their electronic
bolts. Cuzzvi staggered against the fluoroscope, his green face fused
into black mess. The other two assistants made a dash for a door in the
far end of the room. Neither reached it.

A moment later the hybrid officer was bending over Hammond, releasing
him. The other hybrid was doing the same for Storm.

Hammond's mind whirled. He said: "Thanks, boys. We sure--"

He gasped, his fingers tightening on the hybrid's huge arm. The scraggy
bearded face had been pushed back, revealing beneath the disguise
Gena's beautiful features.

"Come!" she said sharply, drawing forth a similar hybrid disguise from
within the garment. "Get into this, Earthman. We have no time to lose.
We must get away from here before Zuggoth returns."

Hammond and Storm obeyed with alacrity. They got into the hybrid
costumes Zuggoth's Sediphrons had used to plant themselves in Gena's
ship. They padded out the huge left arm with a soft, cottonlike
material they found in the laboratory. Ardiné helped them in the task.

In the meantime Gena disappeared in a closet-like room at the far end
of the laboratory. When she returned she held two strange-looking metal
objects, like long, dull tubes with a dial face and a knob. She tucked
these away under her costume without explaining.

Ardiné, also, had been foraging. She came back to them with what seemed
like two small flashlights. Her voice was hurried. "The size reducing
and expanding ray guns. Perhaps we'll have use for them."

Gena nodded. Her voice was quick, determined. "Earthmen, Ardiné and I
are going to make an attempt to capture Zuggoth's ship, and escape back
to Mars. The _Vandar III_ is being repaired, but it will take hours.
Our only hope is the unharmed Sediphron craft."

Hammond caught up one of the electronic rifles. "We're with you, Gena,"
he said grimly. "Lead the way!"

       *       *       *       *       *

The door dilated open as they approached. A moment later they were
marching stiffly down a long corridor.

Hammond gripped the electronic rifle he had taken from Cuzzvi, his eyes
hard under the strange optical openings in the hybrid mask. The ship
was swarming with Sediphrons, searching for the girls who had escaped
from Zuggoth's harem. At any moment--

As if in answer to his worst fears a Sediphron squad appeared from a
side corridor. They halted abruptly. The leader eyed the insignia on
Gena's arm. Then he raised his huge left arm at a diagonal across his
chest, evidently in salute.

Gena's thoughts rasped: "The engine rooms. The First One orders. The
escaped Metiphrons have been sighted."

The Sediphron guard wheeled, went down the corridor at a shuffling
gait. Hammond relaxed, feeling sweat in the palms of his hands, on his
brow.

"This way!" Gena ordered. They cut down the side corridor from which
the guard had emerged, and took a long ramp downward. Several times
they met squads of the ugly crustaceans, but their disguise and Gena's
harsh commands got them by.

They were well down in the ship, cutting across a big machine room,
deserted by the Metiphron workers who tended the whirring machines
when Gena halted. Ardiné and the Earthmen waited while she darted
down a long aisle and vanished into a smaller room beyond where a huge,
turbine-like thing of glinting metal spun with high-pitched hum.

The girl-commander had withdrawn one of the dull metal tubes before
leaving them. She turned the knob, which moved the dial hand, evidently
setting it to desired position.

Several minutes later she was back without the tube.

Ardiné's voice was shaken. "Gena--how long?"

"Four hours!" Gena replied. "Four hours until the degravitator of the
_Vandar III_ blows up." There was regret in her voice.

Hammond kept his silence. But the need for haste now, dogged them as
they followed ramp after ramp down into the ship.

"Hurry!" Gena said again and again.

Some of the route was familiar to Hammond, who remembered being led
along it on his way to Gena's navigation room. He was sure of it when
they stepped into the huge garage where row upon row of war tanks stood
dark and unmoving along the walls.

There was no guard about. Across the room a tank was just rumbling
in, its eight legs clanking metallically. Evidently it was one of the
Sediphron scouts that had been combing the boat for any of Gena's tanks
that might have escaped the surprise attack.

Gena led the way swiftly. They clambered into one of the squat parked
vehicles. A moment later it clanked out, passing the larger one that
was sidling into parking position nearer the door.

They weren't stopped. A moment later they were climbing down the side
of the "big one" to the boat seat, and scurrying across the ridges and
gullies that were strewn with the wrecks of Sediphron and Metiphron war
vehicles.

Through the observation prow Hammond could see the vague maroon cliff
that was the near boat side. For a moment longing assailed him--longing
to be in his own world again, to be out of this fantastic world of
ultra-smallness. His thoughts turned to the ray guns Ardiné carried,
then he dismissed the thought that came to him.

He owed Gena and Ardiné his life; and for what it would be worth he
was with them in this suicidal attempt to wrest from Zuggoth and his
crustacean horde the huge battle craft that had followed the _Vandar
III_ across space.

Zuggoth's ship finally loomed up, like a colossus over the small
tank. Unhesitatingly Gena sent the ambulatory vehicle up the spiny
side. The Sediphron craft was an exact copy of Gena's ship, and the
girl-commander guided the small tank unerringly to one of the dilating
doors that opened to a telepathic command.

The huge room they entered was an exact duplicate of that which they
had left in the _Vandar III_. A Sediphron guard watched them slide the
small tank into parking space. Then his telepathic order crackled into
their thoughts.

"Who enters the flagship of the First One? Answer."

Hammond kept his mind blank. He saw Gena's brow furrow slightly. The
words seemed to sound in his ears. "Volkzv, second in command of hybrid
Intelligence. Searching flagship on order of Zuggoth, the First One.
Gena, commander of the _Vandar III_, and her sub-commander, Ardiné,
have escaped with the two Earthmen. All squads dispatched to the
search. Zuggoth orders!"

There was a moment of hesitation. The hideous Sediphron squad leader's
eyes swayed gently. Then his reply came. "Proceed, Volkzv. We stay to
guard the tank room."

Hammond kept a grip on his thoughts. Stiff-legged, marching with the
shuffling gait of the hybrids, he followed Gena and Ardiné and Storm
out of the war tank, and across the vast chamber to the corridor.

Zuggoth's ship was practically deserted. Evidently only a skeleton
guard had been left behind. All others had been ordered out to battle,
and were now concentrated in the captured Metiphron space cruiser.

Hammond breathed a sigh of relief. It looked as if Gena's desperate
plan might succeed.

The sudden clanging of a huge bell somewhere in the ship's bowels
stiffened them. Storm's quick voice sounded. "The alarm signal! The
tank room guard must have suspected--"

"Come!" Gena snapped. "The control room. If we can take over, and seal
ourselves in--"

       *       *       *       *       *

They hurried along the corridor, ducking into side rooms to avoid being
sighted by squads of the green crustaceans that suddenly sprouted into
being.

Thus, playing a grim game of hide and seek, they finally made their way
up to the control room. But here they ran into a huge, massed group of
the Sediphrons, who had evidently been ordered to await any such move
on the part of the desperate fugitives.

The lurid crackle of electronic bolts fused against the corridor
walls. Storm and Hammond worked their rifles with grim methodicalness,
blasting a half dozen of the green crustaceans into oblivion. But there
were too many of them. They had to fall back along the corridor.

Then Ardiné received a partial shock from a glancing bolt that dropped
her. Storm sprang for her, heedless of the bursting bolts, and caught
her up in his strong arms. Gena and Hammond covered him under a steady
flare of bolts.

With Storm ahead of them they turned and ran.

It was up to Gena. The Earthmen followed blindly, lost in the
bewildering maze of ramps, rooms and corridors.

As if in a grim nightmare they fought their way back through the ship,
escaping annihilation many times by Gena's unerring knowledge of
dilating doors that gave temporary safety.

Once Hammond saw Gena glance down at her chronometer, and he felt
the rise of alarm in her thoughts before she blanked them out. And
the chemist remembered then the time-bomb she had planted in the
degravitator room of the _Vandar III_.

They crossed a momentarily deserted corridor, Storm still carrying the
unconscious Ardiné, and went into a long room that held a maze of long
metal pipe overhead and squat machinery with smaller feeders leading up
to the huge conductors.

Gena's thoughts came to Hammond as they paused here. "If we _must_ die,
let us at least take Zuggoth and his hideous horde with us. I can't let
them get back to Mars now."

Hammond said: "Gena! Wait!"

But the lithe, young Amazon was already running along a row of banked
machinery, withdrawing the second time-bomb from under her hybrid
disguise. In the far wall a green light glowed as she approached. A
door dilated open, and a Sediphron appeared in the opening.

For a moment he hesitated, stalk eyes swaying toward Gena. Then
suspicion fused to purpose, and he swung his electron to target her.

Hammond's rifle lashed out first. Gena scarcely slowed in her run.
She stepped over the crustacean's green body, and vanished into the
degravitator room.

Sweat gathered on Hammond's brow as he waited, rifle held tight in his
right hand. Storm was stroking Ardiné's forehead, his face grim. The
high-pitched hum of the giant degravitator filled the room.

Then Gena returned, swiftly, tearing off her hybrid disguise. "One
hour, Earthmen!" she said, unevenly, her eyes dark with the terrible
strain. "One hour, and then we go down with Zuggoth and his hideous
horde!"

"No!" Hammond's voice was rough. He ripped the disguise from him,
flung it aside. Bronzed and rangy, his square jaw set, he faced the
girl-commander. "You've handled this so far, Gena. But we're not giving
up. We're getting out of here if we have to blast our way through every
foot!"

       *       *       *       *       *

His ringing cry seemed to whip hope into Gena. The strain in her white
face seemed to ease, and a strange smile touched her full lips.

"Earthman, I think I shall like your breed. It does not easily give up!"

They turned away, crossed the huge room just as a squad of Sediphrons
burst in at the other end. Hammond dropped behind, his rifle covering
the burdened Storm and Gena, the girl he loved.

In a swift rearguard engagement, they fought their way out of the
room. Gena's aimed electronic bolt fused the hidden mechanism of the
dilating door through which they escaped, momentarily holding up the
rush of the hideous crustaceans.

"The tank rooms!" Hammond barked, taking command. "You know how to
reach one of them, Gena?"

The girl nodded. Tensed, grim-faced, Hammond followed the girl, keeping
Storm and Ardiné between them, electronic rifle held ready.

A small Sediphron squad patrolled the area, evidently on the alert for
such a break. But the sudden appearance of the Earthmen and the girls
caught them by surprise.

There were eight of them, and four went down to the combined fire of
Gena and Hammond before they could train their rifles. Then Storm,
laying Ardiné on the hard floor, took a hand.

Only one of that crustacean squad emerged from that withering fire. He
succeeded in reaching a huge wall switch. A moment later the huge bell
clanged its harsh alarm through the ship.

Hammond killed him, without regret.

They took the nearest war tank, a small, fast scout vehicle. Gena
sent it clattering toward the far wall just as Zuggoth and a horde of
Sediphrons burst into the room.

The electronic rifle bolts splattered harmlessly against the armor of
the speeding tank. Unharmed the fugitives passed through the dilating
door, and dipped down the side of the huge space craft.

Hammond hung on to the hand grips, watching Storm. The blond American
held Ardiné in the curve of his strong arm, anxiety in his face. Only
when the brunette began to stir, open her eyes, did relief finally ease
the grimness of Storm's face.

The girl smiled up at him, her arms tightening. Hammond took his gaze
away from the oblivious pair, and peered through the observation
windows.

Gena was guiding the small tank along the huge ledge that was the boat
side.

Back of them a score of bigger war tanks were following. Huge rays were
blasting at them, burning scars in the ledge about them.

The small tank finally dipped down the boat side onto the far seat. For
a moment they were safe, out of range of the bigger tank batteries.

Gena brought the tank to an abrupt halt. "Our only chance!" she
snapped. "We must use the size-expanding ray!"

They clambered quickly out. Far across the void between seats the "big
ones" loomed. Nearer, coming toward them along the heaving boat side,
clattered the Sediphron war tanks.

For a brief moment Gena's eyes mirrored a deep regret. Then she set the
adjustment on her ray gun, and turned it on Hammond, while Ardiné did
the same to Storm.

The familiar, whirling darkness, the bitter cold, claimed Hammond.

The darkness faded. He found himself facing Storm on the boat seat. The
skiff was rocking crazily. Hammond teetered, stumbled back into the
stern, and at the same moment Ardiné and Gena appeared.

A wave shipped over the side, washing tiny, antlike things that a
moment before had loomed as colossal war tanks, into the bottom of the
boat. And at the same moment Gena stiffened.

Thrusting from a turret in the Sediphron space craft appeared a small,
glinting tube, similar to the one Gena had used to change them to tiny
mites. In another moment they would experience again the sickening
change to ultra-smallness.

The twin reports, like small firecrackers going off inside the "big
ones," cut across Hammond's instinctive yell to dive overboard. The
space cruisers on the boat seat, with the degravitators gone, seemed
suddenly sucked down with irresistible force. They crashed through the
seat, through the bottom of the skiff, and vanished in a swirl of water.

       *       *       *       *       *

The _Crawfish_ foundered, precipitating Hammond and his companions into
the Sound. Hammond stroked instinctively to Gena's side, but the girl
was as good a swimmer as he.

Ardiné and Storm swam alongside, and together they idled, looking back
to where the _Crawfish_ barely showed between swells, her thwarts awash.

"That's the end of Zuggoth and his crustacean horde!" Storm remarked
with relief. "Both ships must be buried deep in the muck and rock of
the Sound!"

Gena's eyes clouded. Hammond had the sudden knowledge she was thinking
of the Amazon warriors that had gone down with the _Vandar III_. Yet
he knew, too, that it was better this way, than the more horrible fate
that had been in store for them.

Gena stroked closer, her shoulder brushing his. She was still staring
at the bobbing skiff, a strange half-fearful doubt tightening her wet
face. Hammond sensed the trend of her thoughts.

The occupants of the pursuing war tanks, unfitted for water travel,
must have surely drowned. But the huge space craft were water tight. It
might be that Zuggoth and his crustacean horde, buried in the muck of
the Sound, by their tremendous weight relative to their size, would yet
succeed in repairing the degravitator of his ship and win free before
death overtook them.

Hammond thrust the chill apprehension from him. He grinned reassuringly
as Gena looked up at him, eyes dark with uncertainty--with sudden
loneliness. She was no longer master of a million warriors--commander
of a mighty ship of space. She was just a girl, now, soft and lovely
and somewhat afraid.

"Frank," she said softly, tremulously. "What is it like--on Earth? We
are lost, Ardiné and I--"

"Not lost, Gena," Frank answered, his voice serious. Over the girl's
wet shoulder, in the west, he could see the swollen red orb of sun
setting behind the wooded island. He saw farther, into tomorrow,
and after. To his friends in the lab--to a story he knew would be
incredulously received--to a world he and Storm would have to try to
explain to these girls from across the star hung void.

"You'll be with me, Gena," he said, his voice gentle. "As my wife. And
perhaps some day, with your knowledge, and Ardiné's--"

The girl smiled, and followed the line of his upward glance. The
shadows were lengthening across the heaving Sound. But in the still,
flushed sky a pin point of light beckoned, like a smiling answer--the
brilliant disc of glowing Mars.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
