The Ar yn words are As High As Honor.

Their niece Selyse was and is King Stannis’s queen. When Renly died at Storm’s End, the Florents went over to Stannis with al their strength, the first of Renly’s bannermen to do so.

HOUSE FREY

Powerful, wealthy, and numerous, the Freys are bannermen to House Tully, but they have not always been diligent in their duty.

When Robert Baratheon met Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident, the Freys did not arrive until the bat le was done, and thereafter Lord Hoster Tul y always cal ed Lord Walder “the Late Lord Frey.” It is also said of Walder Frey that he is the only lord in the Seven Kingdoms who could field an army out of his breeches.

At the onset of the War of the Five Kings, Robb Stark won Lord Walder’s allegiance by pledging to wed one of his daughters or granddaughters. Two of Lord Walder’s grandsons were sent to Winterfell to be fostered.
