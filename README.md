```
Brief:
Implementation of One-class SVM (Support Vector Machine),
that uses binary, frequency, tf-idf and hadamard representations.
Based strictly on a research paper by Larry M. Manevitz and Malik Yousef,
'One-Class SVMs for Document Classification'.

It includes a graphical user interface with choice of representation,
kernel, data cache, outlier detection and SVM view control.

In addition, it also displays measures (F1-measure, recall, precision). 
Input data is whole books that are split into chunks of 1000 lines each,
and cleaned of stopwords and special symbols automatically.
